# Ethical Questions

## Key Questions
- If competition is involved, does using an LLM constitute "cheating"?
- How can participation rules address the use of LLMs to even the playing field?
- What are the intellectual property implications of LLM-generated content?

## Limitations
- LLMs are not always reliable for judging outputs.
- Feedback should align with organizer goals (e.g., positive reinforcement).
- Sensitive or proprietary data should not be shared with LLMs.

## What should people NOT do with LLMs?
Upload proprietary and/or sensitive data or information
Upload copyrighted materials
Use LLMs alone to make decisions especially about resources or people
Use LLMs to judge quality

## Ethical Considerations for Organizers and Participants

### Participants
- **Idea Generation**:
  - Avoid plagiarism and ensure attribution.
- **Coding Assistance**:
  - Verify generated code for originality and bias.
- **Content Creation**:
  - Ensure factual accuracy and originality.
- **Collaboration**:
  - Communicate transparently about LLM usage.

### Organizers
- **Event Management**:
  - Ensure fairness and transparency in automation.
- **Participant Support**:
  - Train LLMs to provide respectful and accurate support.
- **Judging**:
  - Use LLM evaluations as supplementary tools, not replacements.

## Limitations of LLMs

1. Bias in Outputs.
2. Transparency in Usage:
   - Guidance on ethical considerations.
   - Anonymous surveys to prevent double bind situations.
3. Over-Reliance:
   - Critical thinking should remain central.
4. Safety and Misinformation.
5. Ethical Accessibility:
   - Avoid barriers for less technically proficient participants.


## Additional Ethical considerations
If competition is involved, does using an LLM constitute 'cheating'?
it is important for organizers to be clear on rules and expectations
* How can participation rules address the use of LLMs? (to even the playing fields for all participants?) 
Add - Intellectual property
What are additional considerations and concerns regarding authorship of code/output that come from LLMs 
sharing data with LLMs that is sensitive or you don't own - this becomes part of the training data (!!!!)
