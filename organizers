## Uses for Organizers

### Pre-Hackathon

- Participant survey summary:
  - Cluster participants based on similar or non-similar interests and abilities.

### During Hackathon
- Promote cross-disciplinary ideation.
- Event documentation.
- Feedback form summary.
- Using LLMs to measure outputs (objective measures only, not to judge quality).

### Post-Hackathon
- Document learnings from hackathons using LLMs (e.g., transcripts and outputs fed into LLMs for ELI5 summaries, reviewed by authors).
