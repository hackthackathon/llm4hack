### **1. Ensure Ethical Use of Technologies to Promote Fairness, Transparency, and Accountability**

#### **a. Honesty in Pitches**
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Overstating the project's functionality, such as claiming features are fully implemented when they are only conceptual.
  - Misleading stakeholders about the impact or scalability of the solution.
  - Creating false expectations about the maturity of the project.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Clearly distinguish between functional features and conceptual ideas during presentations or demos.
  - Provide transparent descriptions of the project’s current status, emphasizing it is a prototype if applicable.
  - Be realistic about the potential impact, acknowledging limitations such as resource or technical constraints.
  - Use honest metrics and results; do not fabricate data to strengthen the pitch.

#### **b. Acknowledging Limitations**
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Failing to disclose known limitations, such as inaccuracies in model predictions or reliance on incomplete datasets.
  - Presenting outputs as infallible when they may contain biases or errors.
  - Overlooking critical edge cases where the solution may fail or behave unpredictably.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Proactively disclose weaknesses or areas for improvement, such as lack of robustness in certain scenarios.
- Highlight the potential risks associated with the project, such as incorrect outputs or ethical concerns.
  - Include disclaimers in the pitch and project documentation, explaining that the solution may not perform well under specific conditions.
  - Avoid hiding shortcomings; instead, position them as opportunities for future work.

#### **c. Mitigating Risks**
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Neglecting user privacy and security, such as collecting data without proper safeguards or permissions.
  - Failing to anticipate harmful use cases of the technology (e.g., misuse of an AI tool).
  - Overlooking the societal or environmental impacts of the project.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Implement privacy-by-design principles, ensuring minimal data collection and secure storage where applicable.
  - Conduct risk assessments to identify potential harmful applications of the solution, and document steps to mitigate them.
  - Use mock or synthetic data during development if sensitive data is unnecessary.
  - Clearly explain measures to address ethical concerns in presentations, such as adherence to data protection regulations and bias mitigation strategies.
  - Outline specific next steps for addressing current limitations and minimizing future risks (e.g., additional testing, expert reviews, or external audits).

### **2. Respect Privacy, Intellectual Property, and Licensing Terms**
#### **a. Data Usage**
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Using copyrighted or restricted datasets without permission.
  - Mishandling sensitive personal data like PII or health records.
  - Violating licensing terms of open data sources.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Verify licensing and permissions for datasets.
  - Avoid using sensitive data unless anonymized and explicitly permitted.
  - Use synthetic or mock data when appropriate datasets are unavailable.

#### **b. Intellectual Property (IP)**
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Using copyrighted materials without attribution.
  - Reusing code from proprietary sources without authorization.
  - Misunderstanding ownership of solutions developed during the hackathon.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Attribute all borrowed content (e.g., datasets, libraries, frameworks).
  - Ensure external code is open-source and compatible with your project.
  - Clarify IP ownership with sponsors or hackathon organizers.

#### **c. User Privacy**
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Collecting or processing user data without informed consent.
  - Storing sensitive data insecurely.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Follow privacy-by-design principles (e.g., minimize data collection, ensure encryption).
  - Avoid storing real user data unless necessary and explicitly permitted.
  - Use secure storage and data protection measures.

### **3. Design with Inclusivity, Fairness, and Sustainability in Mind**
#### **a. Inclusivity and Accessibility**
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Reinforcing biases or excluding certain groups.
  - Overlooking accessibility standards.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Test solutions for unintended biases and negative consequences.
  - Follow best practices like WCAG guidelines for accessibility.

#### **b. Sustainability**
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Ignoring environmental impacts of resource-intensive algorithms.
  - Overlooking long-term usability and maintenance.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Optimize computational efficiency.
  - Consider societal and environmental impacts of the solution's lifecycle.

### **4. Focus on Transparency, Integrity, and Accountability**
#### **a. Ethical AI and Automation**
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Developing applications that could be weaponized or cause harm.
  - Building opaque or biased AI systems lacking fairness.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Ensure AI systems are interpretable and mitigate biases.
  - Avoid creating tools with malicious or unethical applications.

#### **b. Fair Competition**
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Using pre-developed projects in violation of hackathon rules.
  - Misrepresenting external tools like LLMs as purely original work.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Ensure most of the work is original and created during the event.
  - Transparently disclose the use of external tools and resources.

---

### **5. Avoid Misrepresenting Capabilities of Projects**
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Overstating application performance or functionality in pitches.
  - Withholding limitations, risks, or known issues during presentations.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Be honest about your solution's capabilities and areas for improvement.
  - Explicitly state risks and limitations, especially for LLM-powered features.
  - Document tools, data sources, and model roles clearly.

---

### **6. Include disclaimers acknowledging risks and limitations of LLM-based solutions**
#### **Key Concerns**:
- Misrepresenting data accuracy or real-time capabilities.
- Ignoring risks of LLM "hallucinations" (confidently stating false information).
- Over-relying on disclaimers while overlooking harmful outputs.

#### **Guidelines**:
- **Address LLM Limitations**:
   - State that outputs may be incomplete, biased, or erroneous.
   - Acknowledge the risks of false information, especially for high-stakes use cases.
- **Example Disclaimers**:
   - "This project’s outputs rely on input data quality and may include biases or errors."
   - "The tool’s predictions are experimental and should not be used for decision-making without verification."
- **Transparency in Functionality**:
   - Do not claim full automation when manual steps or verifications are required.
