# LLM use for Prototyping in Hackathons

## Use Cases for Prototyping with LLMs

- Ideation
- Create digital outputs (e.g., website wireframes).
- Build prototypes with step-by-step guidance from LLMs.

## Limitations for Prototyping with LLMs

- LLMs might not necessarily be able to ouput usable formats, But may claim that they can.
	- LLMs are better suited to write code that can output the desired file formats needed for prototyping. Some outputs require modelling within specialized software so this can be limiting.
  	- LLMs are not good with 3D modelling (yet) but there are efforts underway to address this (example: https://github.com/UMass-Foundation-Model/3D-LLM)
- Check all output in a visualizer, do not assume the LLM output is correct
- Some LLMs might be better suited than others
	- example: chatGPT will lie about its ability to output correct formats while perplexity will not
