# LLM use for Prototyping in Hackathons


Outputs

use an LLM to create a digital output
 - eg website wireframe, drawing to html, 
use an LLM to create a prototype
get step by step
get ideas for your prototype

- LLM

## Prototyping with LLMs

- Create digital outputs (e.g., website wireframes).
- Build prototypes with step-by-step guidance from LLMs.
- Be aware that LLMs might not necessarily be able to ouput usable formats, But may claim that they can. LLMs are woll suited to write code that can output the desired file formats needed for prototyping.
- Check all output in a visualizer, do not assume the LLM output is correct
- Some LLMs might be better suited than others
